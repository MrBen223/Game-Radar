    <h3>PS5 review</h3>
    <h4>By Nick Pino , Adam Vjestica published 25 days ago</h4>

    <p>The PS5 is a powerful and well-designed console that offers a compelling next-gen gaming experience. Its library of exclusive games continues to be a showcase for the PS5’s marvelous DualSense controller, spatial 3D audio tech, and super-fast SSD, and it’s the reason why so many gamers will covet Sony’s new PlayStation console. It might be too big for some setups, though, and a couple of issues hold it back from being a five-star product. However, it's a welcome upgrade over the PS4 and an exciting portal to next-gen gameplay.</p>

    <p>Our expectations for the PS5 were extremely high after the phenomenal success of the PS4. And thankfully, Sony's next-gen console delivers and improves upon its predecessor in almost every aspect.</p>
    
    <h3>Demon's Souls Review</h3>
    <h4>By Adam Vjestica last updated November 19, 2020</h4>  

    <p>Demon’s Souls is a brutal, frequently punishing affair, but the pure elation it offers for those who doggedly persevere is absolutely worth fighting for.</p>

    <p>Demon’s Souls forcibly drives home one simple message from the outset: you will die. It doesn’t matter how patient, careful or skilled a player you might be, because sooner or later, you will die. </p>

    <h3>Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl Review</h3>
    <h4>By Rebekah Valentine Posted: 21 Dec 2021 10:56 pm</h4>

    <p>Developer Game Freak has been doggedly committed to churning out a Pokémon game nearly every year for more than a decade now, but it has seemingly conceded it can’t do it all anymore. For the latest Pokémon remakes, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, it put one of the world’s best-known game series into the hands of a support studio many had never even heard of: ILCA. So what does a Pokémon remake look like without Game Freak in the driver’s seat? Turns out it looks a lot like the Pokémon game that Game Freak made, tip to Tail Whip, without the adventurous differences that defined prior remakes.</p>

    <p>In its marketing materials, we were promised a “faithful remake” of 2006’s Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, and by Arceus, that’s what we got. It’s admittedly hard to look at Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl and not imagine that Game Freak and The Pokémon Company weren’t leaning forward in the back seat, frantically yelling directions. Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are, in almost every respect, meticulously faithful. Fortunately, Diamond and Pearl were pretty darn good games to begin with.</p>

    <p>If a good remake is defined by its loyalty to the original, then Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are very good remakes indeed. They are Diamond and Pearl down to nearly every detail, looking nicer than ever before with a few small tweaks, most of which are pretty good ones. It leaves in some of the original’s roster flaws, but they’re largely forgivable if you’re like me and have some degree of nostalgia for a time when Pokémon’s scope was smaller. And yet, I can’t help but be disappointed that Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl weren’t braver in how they improved upon the originals in the same way other Pokémon remakes were, bringing even some now-historic improvements back to correct history’s mistakes. Of course, I still had a perfectly pleasant time revisiting both Sinnoh and the simultaneously simpler yet more challenging era of Pokémon that took place within it reminded me of a time when this series asked a bit more of us.</p>
