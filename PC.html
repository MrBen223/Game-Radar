    <h3>MacBook Pro (2021) Review: Apple listened</h3>
    <h4>By Patrick O'Rourke</h4>
    <p>With the new MacBook Pro, in a sense, we’re also seeing a very different version of Apple for the first time.</p>

    <p>Seemingly somewhat humbled by the poor reception the last MacBook Pro redesign and its beleaguered Butterfly Keyboard received, its successor aims to solve all of longtime Mac users’ issues with Apple’s previous laptop.</p>

    <p>For example, the new MacBook Pro features the return of MagSafe, an HDMI port and even an SD card slot. However, this comes at a cost, with the new version of Apple’s flagship laptop being thicker, heavier and more expensive than its predecessor. In fact, you could even make the argument the design is a step backwards in some ways.</p>

    <p>With all of this in mind, the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro may only be worthwhile for those who need the additional power these new chips offer. For example, I could easily get by with the 13-inch MacBook Pro and its M1 chip for the next several years. Still, there's something to be said for the built-in SD card slot and HDMI port. Of course, the new MacBook Pro comes at a premium. Apple's new MacBook Pro is available for $2,499 for the 14-inch and $3,139 for the 16-inch at Best Buy, the Apple Store and more. Shipping starts on October 26th.</p>
    
    <h3>THE WITCHER 3: WILD HUNT REVIEW</h3>
    <h4>By Shaun Prescott published May 21, 2015</h4>

    <p>I didn’t really want to leave, though. It’s not that I liked the town, and it’s not that I savoured the fantasy of being a hero to its people. It’s certainly not because I wanted to tick off this town’s quests (there are so many quests, there’s no point being thorough). I was just curious about the villagers’ circumstances. I’d gotten to know the town, but I didn’t understand it. How did they get so poor and wretched? Am I complicit, thanks to my (reluctant) connection with the Nilfgaardians? Is it the climate? Or is it just the way they’ve always lived?</p>

    <p>In true sprawling RPG fashion, that’s not all that The WItcher 3 is about: finding Ciri isn’t the crux of the game’s narrative. Other power struggles come into play later on, and then some other stuff happens, and then… the whole world is at stake and you’re the one to save it. It’s a fantasy RPG, after all, and while the ending is typically grandiose and heartstopping, the main thread would feel a bit rote without its minor story arcs. You won’t care so much that the world is at stake unless you’ve made the effort to learn a bit about it via sidequests. And while newcomers won’t feel punished for skipping the first two games, they’ll miss the rewarding familiarity of old characters and references. To accommodate new players, dialogue options are sprinkled with opportunities to gain background information on plotlines involving historical events.</p>
    
    <p>As a Witcher, Geralt is armed with two swords and five magic abilities called Signs in addition to bombs, crossbows and other, more spoilery strategies. Combat in The Witcher 3 is simple: slash away at your foes, apply effects and buffs where necessary, roll or block to evade, and sprinkle in sign abilities where needed. These signs include a fiery blast, a telekinetic stun, an offensive shield, a mind control ability, and a static magic trap.</p>
